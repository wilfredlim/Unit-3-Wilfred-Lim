First we gotta import the scanner thingy. Then we gotta prompt the user
to enter the games won and total games played. So use text out before using
a scanner. Then divide the number of games won by the total of games played
and then multiply by 100 to get the percent. Then print that number out.
Then I have to make it dummy proof, so this is where the if and else statements
come into play. I'll write a if total games is < 0 then tell them it has to be
above zero. If the total game is less than games won tell them its not possible.
If games won is less than zero, that is also not possible.
